## Output
When the program runs, it will:<br>
>o Alphabetically list all the attractions it knows about with ID numbers. <br>
o Ask the user to enter their starting point and the next attraction they want to visit.<br>
o Ask whether they require a handicapped-accessible route.<br>
o Then it will calculate a shortest path and print clear turn-by-turn navigation
instructions with total distance.<br>
o Then it should allow the user to quit or enter another navigation query, which defaults
to starting at the last end point.
